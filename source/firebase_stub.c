/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * firebase_stub.c -- minimal in-process replacement for the Firebase native
 * libs (libFirebaseCppApp / Analytics / Messaging / RemoteConfig).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The game's first scene runs a FirebaseManager whose bootstrap (StartInitializer
 * InitState::FirebaseLoading) will not advance until the managed dependency check
 * resolves to DependencyStatus.Available (== 0). On a real Android phone that is
 * answered by Google Play Services; on a Switch there is no Play Services, so even
 * a *perfectly working* libFirebaseCppApp would return UnavailableMissing (3) and
 * the game would hang at the exact same gate. The real .so files therefore cannot
 * ever reach the title screen here -- the only thing that works is to report
 * "Available", which is something only a stub can do.
 *
 * On top of that, the real libFirebaseCppApp detonates on load anyway: its
 * JNI_OnLoad logs via firebase::LogDebug through a GOT slot our loader leaves as
 * heap garbage (Instruction Abort at boot). So the real libs are pure liability.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS
 * ------------
 * il2cpp resolves every [DllImport("FirebaseCppApp"/...)] P/Invoke through our
 * fake dlopen()/dlsym() (libc_shim.c). With the real .so files removed, dlsym for
 * any "Firebase_<module>_CSharp_*" / "SWIGRegister*" symbol lands here. We hand
 * back one of two trivial C stubs:
 *   - fb_stub_handle(): returns a non-null pointer into a shared zeroed buffer,
 *     so SWIG proxy objects (FirebaseApp, AppOptions, RemoteConfig, Future, ...)
 *     are non-null and the managed null-cPtr guards don't throw.
 *   - fb_stub_zero():   returns 0, for everything else (status ints, bools, void,
 *     getters that yield scalars).
 * Both ignore their arguments; on AArch64 a fixed-arity C function called with a
 * larger/var arg list is harmless (extra args sit in unread registers).
 *
 * The managed FirebaseApp.CheckDependencies path is synchronous (Task.Run over
 * CheckDependencies(), no Future polling), and returns Available(0) as long as a
 * FirebaseApp instance exists and nothing throws -- which our non-null
 * CreateInternal handle satisfies. Firebase here is cosmetic-only (RemoteConfig
 * banner/news textures); zeroed results just mean those images don't appear.
 *
 * Every lookup is logged so the run's debug.log enumerates exactly which Firebase
 * symbols the game asked for and which stub class we returned -- that's the tuning
 * signal if a specific call needs a different value.
